# roblox-download-audio
this is a shitty nodejs script i made that you can use to download multiple audios from roblox

uses the assetdelivery api for it and you only need the ids of the audios and a valid placeId from a place that has permission for playing the audios

# how to use this gshit djfdgdngdmh
1) open cmd or your terminal or some shit idk i use windows and type `npm install`
2) go into the `settings.json` and change the following values:
```js
  {
    "cookie": "put ur roblosecurity cookie here", // self explanatory
    "placeId": 101010101, // the placeId that has permissions for playing the audios
    "audioIds": [ // the assetIds of the audios (idk if the api has a limit)
        101010101,
        10101010011,
        10101010,
        10101001,
        1010100,
    ]
  }
```
3) once u are done with that just open `index.js` or type in the terminal `node index` or whatevher
4) wait until the process is finished, go to into the "audios" folder where u downloaded this shit
5) enjoy reuploading the audios or something lol

# warning or shtit fdnfgdmgh
from my own experience there may be some audios that are corrupted or something lol
idk how to fix it and probably it's a bug in roblox end
but whatever, it works for the most part
